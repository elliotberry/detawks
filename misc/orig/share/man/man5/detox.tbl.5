.Sh NAME
.Nm detox.tbl
.Nd translation table for
.Xr detox 1
.Sh OVERVIEW
detox allows for configuration of how the ISO 8859-1 and UTF-8
(Unicode) filters operate.  Through text based translation tables, it
is possible to tune how these character sets are interpreted.
.Sh SYNTAX
The format of the translation tables is simple.  There are two levels:
one containing meta data and one containing the actual translations.
.Bl -tag -width 0.25i
.It Cm default Ar _
Default specifies the default translation for a character.  An empty
or nonexistent default indicates that any unknown character should
fall through to the next filter.  In this manner, it is possible to
chain together multiple translation tables in a sequence.
.It Cm start
Indicates the start of a value list within the translation table.
.It Cm start Ar lang
Indicates the start of a language specific value list within the
translation table.
.It Cm end
Indicates the end of a value list within the translation table.
.It Ar value translation
Value can be specified in decimal (1), hex (0x01) or octal (01).  The
same rules that apply to sscanf apply here.
.Pp
Translation can be a string or a quoted string, with either single or
double quotes.
